### International Buyers

International buyers are welcome. All duties and taxes are the buyers’ responsibility. Please check with your local customs office with questions regarding these charges. We will not mark our merchandise below value or mark them as “gifts” as the U.S. and international regulations strictly prohibit such behavior.

### Packaging Fees

Additional fees apply for oversize items and crating charges. Prices may vary but generally these guidelines will apply. Shipping charges are not included in the prices below. Please contact us if you are in need of a freight quote. Items needing a crate may take and additional business day to be processed.

**Wing Crate - $1000.00**

**General Aircraft Control Surface - $40.00-80.00**

**Cowling - $55.00**

### Shipment insurance

On valuable items over $1000.00 insurance is added to the package which costs 1% of insured value (i.e. $5000.00 product = $50.00 to insure)

* Carriers used include:
* UPS Fedex
* USPS
* Estes Express (Freight shipments)


Note: Buyers are welcome to make their own shipping arrangements or provide an account number for an order to be shipped on.

### Returns
