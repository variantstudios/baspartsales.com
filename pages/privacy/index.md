We respect your privacy. We do not give or sell our customer information to outside organizations. Below are the ways your personal information is collected.

### Customer Accounts

Personal and financial information provided to us during the checkout process is used only for payment processing and order fulfillment. This information is required on all orders regardless of how the order is submitted. Customers who create an account on our website can store their information for quicker checkout. The information collected when creating an account includes your full name, billing and shipping addresses, email, and phone number. Creating an account will allow you to:

* Expedite Checkout
* Check the status of current orders
* See a history of your past orders
* See tracking numbers for shipped orders


Customers who do not wish to create an account can checkout as a guest. Guest accounts will not have access to the account features listed above, but you will still receive status updates and tracking numbers via email.

### Notifications

You will receive email notifications regarding the status of pending orders. This may include notices such as an order confirmation/summary, payment status, shipping dates and tracking numbers.

### Cookies

Cookies are used for website functionality only and do not contain any personally identifiable information, nor do they track your web browsing habits outside of our website. Please make sure your browser preferences are set to allow cookies from this website, otherwise the shopping cart and checkout functions will not work properly.
