By using this website, you agree to the following:

1. **ORDER PROCESSING TIME**
   <br>Orders are usually processed within one business day. However, due to the volume of orders, package size, packing requirements(oversize), export documentation (if required) and research involved in processing orders, orders may be delayed an extra business day. We do not process orders on weekends or national holidays.
2. **INVENTORY** Every effort is made to ensure our inventory is accurate, but with the size of our inventory mistakes are made. We reserve the right to cancel any order due to lack of stock. Pictures on items that show multiple quantities may differ slightly from what you actually receive (i.e. color)
3. **OPEN ACCOUNT** Payment by Open Account is available only to legitimate dealers/wholesalers who have an established account, and that account is in good standing. **Accounts must be approved prior to placing an order via this website.**
